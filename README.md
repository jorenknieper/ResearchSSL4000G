# Research in SSL 4000 G channel

Hi there, welcome to my GitHub Repository. In this repository I will cover my research in the SSL 4000 G Channel strip. 

I started thinking about this research on a cold spring morning with a cup of coffee in my hand asking myself,... "Well how accurate are the SSL 4000 G channel plugins vs the real deal? What is the difference between every plugin in CPU Usage? Is there a build up in usage if you use like 4 or 5 or are they using the same memory and CPU usage as a single one? Is it even possible to monitor the latency difference between using a plugin or not in a DAW and is this DAW related or plugin related? How well does the plugin emulate the harmonic distortion if a pre-amp is clipping? How well does it translate the Q bandwidth and the amount of gain on each channel?"



A lot of questions for a sleepy student IT who has a passion for sound engineering. It's because I was mixing a record and I was getting a lot of CPU-usage error's in Pro Tools so I started asking myself what if this plugin would use less CPU and is this CPU even emulating the real deal? It's sounds fine for me and I don't have a problem but is this the real sound of a SSL 4000 G channel? 

Before we start to dive into gathering results and data to analyze, we definitely need to write down some cases where we have a problem in a digital world with CPU and RAM usage going up in projects. Why we are so interested in getting to know the truth if a Plugin sounds like the real deal, even if it's sounding fine for you? This is not a subjective thing, it's a research so we are going to compare the results. What sounds the best for you is up to you! In that case there is no good or wrong. But this research will be about covering a lot of aspects in trying to get as close as the real thing (as sellers are telling us when they sell the plugin).
